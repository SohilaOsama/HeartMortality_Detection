# Data Mining and Machine Learning Pipeline

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate a comprehensive data mining and machine learning pipeline. The notebooks cover data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, providing a practical approach to handling real-world datasets.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

### **Main Files**
- **`FinalCode.ipynb`**:  
  The final compiled notebook that combines all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation. This notebook is a concise summary of the entire pipeline.

- **`Practical_Assignment_1_DataMining_SohilaOsama.ipynb`**:  
  A practical assignment showcasing a hands-on approach to solving data mining problems.

- **`README.md`**:  
  This documentation file provides an overview of the repository, its structure, and usage.

### **Pipeline Notebooks**
The pipeline is broken into modular notebooks for better organization and reusability:

1. **`code_1_explore_missing_duplicate_data_type_category.ipynb`**:  
   Focuses on:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Detecting and resolving duplicate entries.
   - Exploring data types and categorical features.

2. **`code_2_train_test_split.ipynb`**:  
   Covers splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, ensuring no data leakage.

3. **`code_3_explore_multicollinearity_imputation.ipynb`**:  
   - Identifies multicollinearity between features.
   - Applies imputation strategies for missing data.

4. **`code_4a_logreg_regz_search_oversample_decision_boundary_alpha.ipynb`**:  
   - Hyperparameter tuning for logistic regression.
   - Incorporates regularization, oversampling (e.g., SMOTE), and decision boundary analysis.

5. **`code_4b_logreg_regz_final_model.ipynb`**:  
   Implements and evaluates the final logistic regression model based on the best-found hyperparameters.

6. **`code_5a_search_other_models.ipynb`**:  
   Explores alternative machine learning models, such as decision trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods.

7. **`code_5b_knn_search_oversample_neighbours.ipynb`**:  
   Conducts a detailed hyperparameter search for k-Nearest Neighbors, including oversampling techniques.

## Prerequisites
The notebooks are created using Google Colaboratory, so you can run them without installing additional software. However, to run the notebooks locally, you need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `imbalanced-learn`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```
